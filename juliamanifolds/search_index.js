Our main interface is ManifoldsBase.jl, describing how to define a manifold. The main package build upon that is a library of Riemannian manifolds, Manifolds.jl. On the other hand we provide packages that provide tools for general manifolds using the main interface, like Manopt.jl to perform optimization on Manifolds, ManifoldDiffEq.jl to solve differential equations, or ManifoldDiff.jl to provide AD tools for functions deifned on manifolds.","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"While all these packages have their own documentation, they are aggregated here as well using MultiDocumenter.jl to have a single place for all documentation, especially the overarching search functionality.","category":"page"}]
